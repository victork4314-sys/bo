# BioSpeak Full Distribution Workspace

All source code and build assets now live inside the [`BioSpeak_Full`](BioSpeak_Full/) directory. The reorganized structure keeps the CLI, PyQt6 desktop studio, offline web experience, installers, and release automation in a single portable folder as requested. Please refer to [`BioSpeak_Full/README.md`](BioSpeak_Full/README.md) for comprehensive documentation and build instructions.
